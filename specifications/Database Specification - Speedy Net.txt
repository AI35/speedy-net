Hi,

Here is the Database Specification for Speedy Net.

Database: MySQL with the InnoDB storage engine. We will use foreign keys in the database (if the database becomes bigger, this can be changed). We should build the database tables to be able to handle many users, such as hundreds of millions of users.

- We need a table "usernames". A username can be assigned to a user, page, group or cause or alias. Also some usernames will be reserved by us. A username will be unique, and the limit on number of usernames per user will be 5 or 10 (as I explained in the specification).

- I want to combine tables "pages", "groups" and "causes" to one table ("pages"). Remember a page, group or cause may or may not have a username. Also, a page, group or cause may be in more than one language, but there will always be a default language for every page, group or cause. If the page, group or cause does not have a username, it will have a slug with it's unique ID (15 digits). If the page, group or cause has a username, it will be redirected to the URL with the username (if user enters URL without username), for example "en.speedy.net/username/".

- Remember a user can have a firstname and lastname in more than one language. Every user will have to supply these fields in English, but in addition he or she can supply the firstname and lastname in other languages.

- I want interests, favorite music, movies, TV shows, books etc. To be very similar to Facebook, so that a user will add for example "Madonna" and the page of Madonna will be added to his or her favorite music. The user will be able to sort interests, favorite music, movies, TV shows, books etc.

- Every language will have a username too, which will be the language's name in English in lowercase letters. For example "english", "spanish" etc.

- Remember a user can create unlimited number of pages, groups or causes without a username, only the number of usernames will be limited.

- Each user's profile will contain the following elements:
	Basic Information:

- The user's time zone will also be saved to the database.
		
- When viewing a profile, only non-empty fields will be visible. When editing a profile, all fields will be visible to edit.

- The user can select his relatives (if they are on Speedy Net they will have to confirm).

- Friends will also have to confirm (if they are on Speedy Net). Users will be able to add relatives and friends not on Speedy Net, in this case they can enter their email address to invite them to join.

- When tagging pictures, the person's relatives and friends will all be options, and also new people can be tagged - even if they are not on Speedy Net.

- A maximum of 800 friends and relatives will exist.

- Each user will have the following tabs:
	Wall
	Info
	Photos
	Notes
	Friends
	
- The main website will have the following options:
	News Feed
	Messages
	Events
	Friends
	Pages
	Groups
	Causes
	Photos
	Notes
	Links

- A page, group or cause will have the following tabs:
	Wall

		Basic Information:
			Address: [write text]
			City/Town: [write text]
			Zip: [write text]
			Founded: [write text]

			Phone: [select one or more]
			Website: [select one or more URL]
	Photos
		Photo Albums (like in a user's profile)
	Discussions
	[User defined tabs]

- People will "Like" a page, "Join" a group or "Support" a cause (also "Unlike", "Leave Group" or "Leave Cause" to cancel). Except this - pages, groups and causes will be the same.

- The number of people who like a page, join a group or support a cause will be unlimited.

- An event will have the following fields:
	When? [Date, Time and Time Zone] [optional ending date and time]
	What are you planning? [text]
	Where? [text]
	More info? [text]
	Who's invited?
		Select Guests [from friends and relatives]
		Public event [checkbox - default is checked]
		Show the guest list on the event page [checkbox - default is checked]
		
- The URL of an event will be en.speedy.net/events/[event number], where event number will be a random number of 15 decimal digits. We may change it to use slugs later.

- Each user will be able to set the following options for an event:
	- Attending
	- Maybe Attending
	- Not Attending
	
- A user ID, page ID, group ID, cause ID or event ID will also be random with 15 decimal digits.

- An album ID or photo ID will be random with 20 decimal digits.

- Here is how a user ID, page ID, group ID, cause ID or event ID will be created:
	1. A random number between 100,000,000,000,000 and 999,999,999,999,999 will be selected.
	2. Table `speedynet_ids` will be queried to see if this ID exists.
	3. If it exists, return back to step 1 and calculate a new random number.
	4. Add the new ID to table `speedynet_ids` (with `type` and with `creation_date`=NOW()).
	5. Add the user, page, group, cause, event, album or photo to the table with the new ID.
	(MySQL auto increment will not be used).

- And the same for album ID or photo ID - 20 digits (with a different table).

- All the English text in the website will be saved to table `language_texts`, so if we want to enable more languages in the future, we will not have to change the source code.

- Right to left languages such as Hebrew and Arabic will be supported.

- A user must have at least one username (on table `users`). To check how many usernames a user has (to enforce limits), query tables `users`, `pages` and `aliases` and count the records with `user_id`=this_user_id (table `users`) or `owner_id`=this_user_id (tables `pages` and `aliases`). In all tables, count only the records where `username` is not NULL.

- If a page, group or cause don't have a username and page_name, their URL will be "en.speedy.net/pages/[page ID]" (for pages), "en.speedy.net/groups/[group ID]" (for groups) or "en.speedy.net/causes/[cause ID]" (for causes). We may also support slugs that start with the ID.

- Pages created by editing the user's profile will have `owner_id`=NULL.

- An album will have the following fields:
	- Album Name: (text)
	- Location: (text)
	- Description: (text)
	- Caption: (text)
	- Privacy: "everyone" or "friends only"

- A photo will have the following fields:
	- Caption: (text)
	- Tags: sorted from left to right. (multiple tags for one photo are permitted).
	- One photo per album will be the album cover.
	
- In tags, the same person can't be tagged in the same picture more than once (if they are on Speedy Net). But two tags with the same name are allowed (if two people have the same name).
