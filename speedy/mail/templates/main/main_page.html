    {% blocktrans with site_name=site.name %}We are looking for volunteers to help us develop Speedy Mail Software, a free software and open source web-based e-mail such as Gmail. We want the mail to be as similar as possible to the excellent e-mail of Google, Gmail. When we develop such a mail software, we intend to run a free e-mail service to all members of Speedy Net, so that the username of each person at Speedy Net + the speedy.net domain name will be the email address of the user. In the past we operated an e-mail like this, but unfortunately we had to close it because it was a lot worse than Gmail, in terms of features and storage, and also because we were not able to control the problem of spam ("junk mail") sent to our clients. But if we can recruit volunteers to create a good e-mail program, we will reactivate Speedy Mail and will allow any company or organization to operate a similar web-based e-mail on their site.{% endblocktrans %}<br />
    <br />
    {% blocktrans with site_name=site.name %}Speedy Mail Software will use the Python and JavaScript languages. Speedy Net is also free software and open source. If you are interested in volunteering, please contact me by e-mail.{% endblocktrans %}<br />
