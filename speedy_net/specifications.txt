 - Speedy Specification 0.1 -

Speedy Net acts like a social network which supports extensibility with Django applications.
The first milestone concentrates on the main application - user management.

 - APP REQUIREMENTS -

main app is responsible for:
* registration
* login
* profile
* password reset
* email account confirmation


 - MAIN APP MODELS -

* ManagedEntity - responsible for ID & username uniqueness, holds the slug and model type. (Abstract class references Identity)
* UserProfile - user model.
* UserEmailAddress - holds email addresses.
* UserMessage - messages sent between users.

In addition to our own models, we use the friendship to add friends and followers mechanism.

 - MODEL REQUIREMENTS -

ManagedEntity requirements:
* unique username (should strip from special characters on save).
* unique slug (should replace forbidden characters to '-' and strip consecutive '-').
* unique ID between 1000000000000 - 1000000000000000 (randomly generated, not sequential).
* model type.

ManagedEntity validates the fields and is saved before the user profile.


User requirements:
1. should inherit all properties from the ManagedEntity model.
2. multiple email addresses. (may login with any of them - not implemented yet)
3. User shall be active only after he confirms the email.
